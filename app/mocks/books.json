				"description": "For any online business that can sell its products globally, multilingual digital marketing will be a big part of their marketing and selling efforts. In 21st century the push to expand into new areas of the world will increase as the competition tightens. For businesses that are currently struggling because of the competition found in their home languages, it means an opening of new, large areas of interested customers who speak different languages. By tapping into new markets, a business may see its customer base skyrocket depending on how well they can advertise their products into these areas. There are several advantages that multilingual marketing offers businesses that are seeking new customers from parts of the world that speak a different language. The challenges are present, such as effective translation that appears natural, but the potential in 2017 is considerable. The first and foremost benefit is that your product is being introduced to an entirely new audience. If what you offer is unique, then you have a considerable opportunity to expand your business with little to no direct competition. However, even if you are marketing familiar products, you are most often facing less competition which makes it easier to sell. In previous editions one discussed about ecommerce and market leadership. In the fifth edition you will be taken to a new journey in online marketing from creating a successful business plan, sales strategies, multilingual website design, marketing strategies in foreign countries, multilingual social media marketing for businesses, politicians and celebrities and share of wallet strategies.",

				"description": "Omni channel is not just a fancier name for multi channel. It represents a truly new methodology that is customer centric and non linear. It provides a seamless experience to the customer no matter the channel they interact with. Marketing today is more about outcomes than interactions. Outcomes are what omni channel marketing is all about, putting the customer at the center of the brand experience so that engagement turns into revenue and loyalty. There are major people, process, and technology challenges with moving from multi channel to omni channel. This requires a real strategic focus and commitment. In this day and age, there is a proliferation of channels and tactics and it is highly recommended that you, as a marketer, need to have a broad understanding of all of this. To learn more you need to understand channels to some level of detail before embarking upon omni channel personalization.",
